I stumbled on this pc while looking for parts to build a new computer. The price of this thing is a steal at 1100 dollars. 11th gen I7, 3060ti, water-cooled. It was a great deal. So, after it arrived, I've been playing on it for over 2 weeks. It has been running beautifully, it plays Elden Ring on Ultra just fine, Cyberpunk on high settings at a consistent 60fps, and Overwatch 2 on ultra (I play on 1080p not 4k, keep that in mind). My cpu temps run just fine as well, it averages around 50c with a workload on it and gpu temps are around 60c. Max I've seen them run is 70c but I went into MSI Center and ramped my fans up to 100% and they lowered quite a bit. Now, the downfall of this pc is the RAM. I was promised 16gb of 3200mhz ram. It currently sits at 2667mhz as I am typing this. My friend has this exact PC and his runs at 3200. So I'm not sure what's going on here but my RAM is definitely off. I have ordered 32gb of 3200mhz that is on the way. Which I planned on upgrading the ram anyway, but i had to buy 4 sticks instead of 2 sticks. Also, I do not trust this water-cooler or Power supply. Both are off brand and I plan on replacing them before they go out. I know I have said some pretty big cons in this review, however, I think this is a great pc so far. It hasn't let me down yet, the m.2 is fast as hell. I really like it, but I do plan on making upgrades to it soon for longevity and efficiency.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

package arrived with no damage opened box and installed this 1660 Super in my wifes gaming desktop(one of wally world specials) had a little problem getting the connectors to hook up to the power. other then that PC saw video card i went to Nvidias website and played GTA. and  immediately saw a BIG diffrence in the graphics. also tested RDR2  the ONE game she couldnt play thanks to HP!  loaded that up and my wife was very happy. thought Video card was gonna be bigger but it fitWOULD  order from this seller again.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.
"

Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)

Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Decent 30 series under 350. Runs tests and games no problem. Quiet fans.

Graphics are great and I wasn't dissatisfied. Was watching the prices fluctuate and eventually got it for $329+ tax. When I started looking, it was at $430.My previous experience was a nvidia geforce 630 and it blew me away. <insert ""a whole new world""-aladdin>

¬†Meanwhile in the video it sounds, in real life it‚Äôs really half as loud as the mic captures, you won‚Äôt notice it, actually the case‚Äôa fans, are the louder stuff in there. (Recorded while had gpu at 100% and at open case; with closed case it‚Äôs much less)Now that it‚Äôs cheaper really adds value

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Overall great card if you are not interested in RTX performance (ray tracing). I was skeptical buying this brand again after getting a DOA AMD 550 a year or so ago during the great video card shortage. I was also concerned over getting a refurbished mining card. However, the box seemed intact and the card itself looked new without any dust or dirt anywhere to be seen on the card itself or cooling system.I have the 6800xt mated with an AMD 5600x, an X570 Aorus mobo (capable of enabling SAM), and 32gb of AMD optimized RAM. My primary display is a 4k 120Mhz OLED 65‚Äô TV. So far I am able to max out all settings in 4k with frames ranging from dips to the mid 40s to maxing out my display at 120fps. On average, I been getting 60-80 fps.The card does run hot (look for JUNCT temp). I have to set my fan speeds aggressively both with my case and GPU. The fans on the Red Dragon are loud when running above 50% speed or so (especially as you go over 65%). There is a bios switch on the Red Dragon that allows for underclocked ‚Äúsilent‚Äù running‚Ä¶ without that enabled (or a waterblock installed) expect a decent amount of fan noise and heat as you push your GPU in most modern games at 4k.While the card does have RTX cores, turning on full ray tracing in games like Dying Light 2 and Cyberpunk 2022 at 4k is, personally, unplayable. However, the RTX cores are nice to have and maybe some performance can be salvaged from them with future driver optimizations and games partnered with AMD tech.I am happy with my purchase as maxing out my settings at 4k with frames 60fps or higher without spending any more then necessary was my goal. Giving up RTX performance was always on the chopping block for me given the outrageous mark up on the 6800xt/3080 + level cards lately. Things look even worse with NVIDA‚Äôs new 4000 series cards with unprecedented MSRPS for both their 4080s and 4090s. Call me old fashioned but paying $600-$800 is an already healthy markup on said models, trying to keep the crypto prices alive is beyond greedy.Amazon giving me a 5 months interest free option @$614 on this GPU was the magic number combo for me.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.

I've been wanting this card since I built my pc because I was doing an all-white build, and I noticed a big difference right away since I was upgrading from a 1660 Super.

Used it for my wife's all white build. There is no RGB, just white light on the Zotac Gaming. Looks good and kills 1080p gaming. Wife is getting 200+ FPS in R6 Siege, and around 70 in Shadow of The Tomb Raider, on high.
"
B09256CTT3,"
This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

My graphic needs are kind of low. Video playing (some light editing), old games, and playing with 3D printing so this card is quite fine in my Xeon computer. 4 output is also great for at home office. It is my 3rd one, I don't need power and it is reliable. Running on W10 (I shortly tried W11 and it was ok) and many Linux flavors flawlessly.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
Best gpu for the pc enthusiast
"

After a couple months of use, I can run any game I have installed at 1080p and highest settings. Once I get a 1440p monitor I will update this review with results. Top tier GPU, will run anything.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.

Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

B07TZ4VFB6,"
I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"

I purchased a pre-assembled gaming computer in 2011 that featured an AMD PowerColor 6670 1GB GPU, paired with a 2500k i5 [Sandy Bridge] Intel Processor, on an Asus Intel H61 Motherboard. While that setup got me through the years, it was starting to show its age on modern 3D applications, especially with the OpenGL being out of date.Before pulling the trigger on the GPU upgrade, I was concerned that the GTX 1050 Ti wouldn't function with my CPU which is only ""rated"" to support PCI-E 2.0, and not 3.0, as many forums claimed. I was happy to do further research, and learn that they do in fact cooperate just fine! The only down side is that I may never see the full potential of this card until I upgrade my GPU, as my current one could act as a bottle-neck under high load (which I will never experience, since I play mostly older games anyways.)The conclusion is that I am extremely happy with this upgrade, and I don't think I could have made a better choice given my current setup.* For the record, I have also upgraded my power supply from a 400W to a 600W, switched to SSD primary drive, went from 4GB to 8GB of DDR3 system RAM., and added 2 large fans.
"
B01M360WG6,"
Let me start by saying I am not a gamer, Play Station games on PCSX2 emulator is the most demanding I play. I was suprised to see that games even an old game like Sly2 would play at all with integrated graphics; it has slow choppy parts; however using the 1050ti GPU speeds up the slow down spots and makes great game play: better than it was 18 years ago. The 1050 came out more than 6 years ago so you may think it outdated in 2022; I ASUS thinks so: the driver was updated in July 2022 and I think they would have wasted the resources on Updates for outdated hardware. When I built my pc a few years ago the price of graphics cards was through the roof, I planned to upgrade later, I was so happy to find such a well manufactured card at such a low price!The only negative is the card card came in a box with just a two page manual, no CD, no posters, nothing else; but that is all I needed, I would have visited the website to download the latest driver anyway, and as for the books and ads who looks at those anyway?

If you are upgrading your current GPU card then this budget card is the one to get. Keep in mind that you should check your motherboard or GPU specs and see if it supports PCIe 16, x16 or dual x8. Since this 1050 Ti is PCIe 3 it still works fine in a PCIe 2.0 slot.My Specs:OS - Windows 10 Pro 64-bitMOBO - ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. 970 PRO GAMING/AURA (Socket 942)CPU - AMD FX-8350 Vishera 32nm TechnologyGPU - 4095MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 TiRAM - GSkill 32.0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 802MHz (11-11-11-28)Drive - Samsung SSD 870 QVO 2TB (SATA (SSD)The MOBO is a few years old but you have no worries if your current setup supports PCI-E X16 slot.Suggestion is to run a GPU test on it with NovaBench and/or Unigine Heaven Benchmark apps. Another suggestion is to remove all of of your old graphic drivers before you install this new GPU card and then install the new drivers for this card and do a fresh install.I achieved up to 150 fps during bench marking with no hiccups. Great card - glad I got it. Cheers!

i had gotten this over a year ago during the very end of the scalping prices and spent 300+ on this...  kinda hurt that after a month and a half the scalping prices went way down but still worth it!  been very reliable and useful for gaming pcvr, still happy i got this when i did!

I slammed it in a Lenovo ThinkCentre M92p Minitower. It's better than the pc, but I'm poor.

The main reason that I bought the card was to speed up my photo editing software. The card has made a huge difference in the speed of the applications, and I'm totally satisfied so far. I don't do gaming at all so I can't comment on the performace of the card in a gaming scenario. The card seems to be good value for the money.

It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.

This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away

B09719T6FT,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"

Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue

Lo seleccion√© por su potencia, la marca que es muy reconocida, el precio y tambien se suponia que no consumia mucha energia, pero cuando me lleg√≥ me di cuenta que pedia 300w minimos, eso creo que es muy importante y deberia estar muy visible en la descripcion del producto, y no lo esta, espero que lo pongan, es muy importante, otra cosa que no me gusto mucho y no se si suceder√° con las demas es que esta en letras peque√±as decia precaucion, peligro de cancer, en su guia aparece con unos 5 compuestos quimicos peligrosos en sus componentes, eso no me gusto nada aunque no s√© si sera cosa de todas las tarjetas, fuera de esto, excelente, envio super rapido , aunque la caja tenia una abolladura pero creo que no tendra repercucion con la tarjeta

It‚Äôs not intended for gaming but if u need to get some power taken off ur cpu it is a good little compliment to a pc. It‚Äôs a little better than built in gfx and the only game I wasn‚Äôt able to run was halo infinite(no antialiasing running at 1366x768- down scaled 1080p running at 15-45fps). Also make sure u turn anti aliasing off or u ain‚Äôt getting anything out of it. (The ddr5 variant is significantly better but still in the same ball park)

I really like the price of this GPU. It was easy to install in my Dell Optiplex 7010 SFF. There was many reviews stating that this was not a card for gaming but I bought it to try it out compared to my GeForce GT 710. This GT 1030 has boosted my FPS on all the games I play such as Ark Survival Evolved, Satisfactory, Fortnite, Minecraft and others. I changed my setting in games to high levels and it runs smoothly with no dropped rates. Best value for the money.

I built a new PC. The CPU has an integrated video adapter, but video stutters sometimes, so I got this discrete video adapter, and it solved all my woes. I chose Gigabyte and NVidia for their reputations for quality (and because NVidia is known to be compatible with Linux distributions), and I have NOT been disappointed! I recommend this adapter for anyone who needs a great video experience.My2Cents,Ernie

Replaced an older video card with this unit working with an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU and 32 gigs of DDR4 ram and it works great right out of the box. The colors in Pictures and videos  are lifelike, crystal clear, bright and beautiful.

I bought 2 of these cards. one to replace the failed GT 620 in my dad's PC and one to replace the still functional but older GT 710 in my HTPC. these cards are not being used for gaming as they are the DDR4 version, but they will do just fine for display adapter use.

I can‚Äôt speak as to how this card relates to a gaming environment because I use it in a traditional desktop environment.  In the context of my usage, this card works very well.  It was easy to install and setup.  I am very satisfied with it.

Fantastic! I‚Äôm not a heavy gamer, but I do stream lots of Netflix, youtube, also watch tv using my Hauppauge usb tv dongle. Effortless 1080p, even 4k at 144fps! Beautiful, brilliant colors, depth, contrast, no artifacts or other annoyances on both Windows 10 and Linux Mint Debian 5 at default settings. Except maybe the fan it‚Äôs a tad noisy. But when I‚Äôm blasting music/videos, my bitcoin miner fans are spinning or the house AC is on the Zotac‚Äôs fan is a non-issue. I sometimes use my office as a recording studio for voice overs, voice acting and on rare occasion I pretend to sing. So I‚Äôll need to tinker with fan settings eventually. My previous desktop used a passively cooled Zotac which was quieter, but I don‚Äôt know if that option is still out there as GPU‚Äôs continue to be more and more powerful. Fit perfectly in my HP 590-p0024, which I had previously upgraded to a 400w psu (proprietary form factor that I had to buy direct from HP), removed the hard drive, added 3 SSD‚Äôs and an AX wifi card with external antenna. With the Zotac card and everything else running I‚Äôm still using less than 120w most of the time. Wrote this review after several hundred hours of burn in & card is still going strong. I‚Äôve had great luck with Zotac products in the past, and I‚Äôm confident this one is just as solid. Highly recommended!

Ok, this version does not use a pcie port to power, i put that away snuggly. It just sits in the slot period.for some reason this version of this video card DDR6 vs DDR5 has gone up past the boosted 1620 rating all the way to 1950mhz and that is daily. Maybe I have a better card than most or maybe that what they do.I have an 8310 amd processor 8 cores default 3.4 ghz havent tried the card at that speed with this gpu. Only overclocked at 3.8ghz. I have 16 gb or ram.. so 3.8ghz 16gb ram and this video card. I play back for blood ... aka Left for dead 3 on 1920 by 1080 settings and it plays fine, no stutter no issue. If you set the video for anything less than that. the game doesnt play smooth because the processor is old and not fast enough for the game or the video card. So if you have an old system like I do. Make your gpu do most of the work by playing at your native gpu monitor settings.. let the video card absorb the graphics since it has 4gb and let your old processor push the gpu along. The gpu is quiet it works. Its faster than what is advertised. this is the 128bit 4gb 192GB.......... per second updated video card 896 cuda cores.. the normal gtx 1650 is 128 bit 4gb 128GB....... per second 896 cuda cores.. So this gpu has faster memory and can handle more megabytes per second and it seems to be just as fast as faster than the super version.. If this video card last. This is a deal. I paid 325 for this video card in 2021. New.. It use to cost half the price but there is a gpu shortage in the world.. Currently ... I have had this card exactly two weeks. I prefere EVGA products but I have noticed Zotac around for years and years and havent heard anything bad about it. Stable using Aida Extreme. Currently at idle posting this review it says this gpu is using 32.63watts.. My old gtx 460.. yes 460 I think uses as much as 170 watts. I think they said this gpu uses max 75 watts.. I am happy with this gpu. Not the price, but the gpu .. If you have a ryzen cpu 6 core or better and 16gb of ram you will fly through many games, using this video card. This is an FX 8310 CPU that I am using has 8 cores stock3.4 overclocked to 3.8.. I didnt overclock to 4.0 if I didnt need to. Apparently I dont need to...That means with the gpu I can play many games.. Back For Blood was released this year I believe in October 2021 ... I am playing an updated brand new game in 2021 with a cpu that came out in 2014 all old equipment asrock 970m pro 3 , ddr3 gskill memory, zotac 1650 ddr6 version and a samsung 970 ssd drive. Go on youtube and type the type of cpu you have and video card you want and see what games people are able to play using what you have. if you have phenom then type that and the game you want. if you have fx 8350 ... type that and the game that you want.... the video card will work for many games. You just need to make sure your cpu is also strong enough to not bottleneck your game play as much , so everything will be smooth

Quck Summary:  Don't expect to handle all games at high settings, but for the price it has very good performance and works with 300w power supply without additional graphics power.  I would highly recommend over Radeon RX 550 or GeForce GTX 1050 Ti OC.Reason for Purchase:  Upgrade old PC with onboard graphics to be able to play games. The main concern was that the power supply was able to handle powering the card.  Since it did not come with added GPU power I opted for a low power card to save on upgrading the power supply also.PC Specs: - Asus VivoPC K31CD - 8GB DDR4-2400 - CPU Gen 7 i5 quad core 3Ghz - Power Supply: 300 Watt (No graphics card power available, Needed to be powered by the PCI-E bus)Purchased: This graphics card and 32GB (Max) DDR-4I was planning on getting the Radeon RX 550 at first or the GTX 1050 Ti OC because this was an old under-powered PC and I wanted the most bang for the buck.  My newest MacBook Pro has the 550 in it and it handles my steam games good, but struggled on Quern at high res (21 FPS).  So I was leaning toward the 1050 Ti when I came across this beauty.  It claims to be 50% more powerful than the 1050 and it was actually cheaper so I went for it.It had no issues with power and handles Quern at 60-70 FPS.  This was my benchmark since the 550 seemed to start choking around that.  Also tried Factorio, Skyrim, Borderlands, and BioShock Infinity.  All older games but it handled them all wonderfully.  Very successful upgrade.

I had this same card by MSI for 2.5 years after it started to show artifacts when i play videos or games. I was hoping to get this MSI card last until the 40 series is out. I decided to pick up this ZOTAC 1650 and hopefully it'll serve me another 2-3 years. I run photoshop and revit on my 4k monitor, no problem. I play yakuza series, ghost recon wildlands, borderlands 3 all at 4k with no issues. For the newer games, I don't think I can max out on the graphic settings. It's a servicable card.

B0881YZJ45,"
Let me tell you, when I can go from playing Black Ops 3 at 720p 60fps (with a 1030) to 4k 60fps; it's the greatest and most pleasurable feeling in the world.
"
B0881YZJ45,"
it was easy to set up. however it is hard to found a GPU that your pc can handle. the one I got was a 1650 it is the maximum to my pc can handle I'm not saying its bad just make sure you buy the right one :)

First, to everybody saying that this card is ""loud,"" I disagree. Maybe you got a bad one? Mine is super quiet. Second, if you're like me, and you just bought a new 2022 HP or a Dell (in my case the HP Pavilion Desktop PC TP01-2000i) with tons of RAM and a super-fast 11th gen Intel processor and an SSD and were very excited until you popped the hood and realized that the power supply (PSU) is proprietary, has no available power cables, and doesn't pack enough power to run your dedicated video card even if it did, this is your ONLY cost-efficient solution. The Intel 750 UHD that came with my new HP computer is awful. I score in the mid 20th percentile on 2D and 3D tests using Performance Test 10.1 even with the 11th gen processor and 64GB of RAM. I need a dedicated GPU for video editing, and the Zotac is one of a few reasonable solutions because it's compact and fits in the small space available (see photo) and does NOT require external power. It works great with the 310-watt PSU in my HP even though it says it requires around 375 watts. Not a problem. Best part is that I'm now getting close to the 60th percentile on 2D and 3D tests using Performance Test, which is a massive upgrade over the integrated Intel UHD 750. I don't game hardly at all, but according to ""Can I Run It?"", I could, if I wanted to, play 96 out of the top 100 games. With 4GB of fast onboard RAM, I'll be able to do what I need to do in the way of video editing. What a relief. I should have done more research on the computer I bought it, but at least I can do what I need to do now.

It's 2022, why is this video card $350?  The supply chain shortage has caused many wierd issues, most notably any decent video cards are now above retail.  This one is bad, but I guess it's only $100 over the list price of $249.  So bad start on value.What it does have is 75w power consumption which means no special power pigtails.  In addition it is no boast that this thing runs in 99% of the systems.I am using it in my Lenovo M83.  Yes my stock M83 with the stock 240w power supply and stock i7-4770 cpu.  If anyone in the future is reading this.  Yes i got it work, yes it was a PITA to figure out.  Step1 update to latest BIOS.  Step2, remove any graphics cards (i had the stock GT730 card), and boot to bios with onboard video.  Step 3, reset bios to defauls.  Step 4, change to IGP (used to be auto), and set to multimonitor).  Step5, leave monitor plugged into onboard video, and install 1650.  Step 6, boot windows 10 and install nvidia drivers.  Step 7, shutdown move to the monitor output of the 1650, and boot into windows... at this point it works great for me.  I suspect this will be similar to other lenovos so it might give others hope.Now why 4 stars?  1 overpriced for what it is...  2 it is just not very fast, but i guess we take what we can get, given the package limitations.
